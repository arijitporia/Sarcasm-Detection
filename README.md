The aim of a convolution network is to reduce frequency variation through convolutional filters and 
extracting discriminating word sequences as a composite feature map for the LSTM layer.
RNN has demonstrated the power of semantic modelling
quite efficiently by incorporating feedback cycles
in the network architecture. RNN networks include a temporal memory component, which allows
the model to store the temporal contextual information
directly in the model.
